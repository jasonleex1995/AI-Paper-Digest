**Generalisation in humans and deep neural networks**    
*NeurIPS 2018*, 
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08750), [review](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/hash/0937fb5864ed06ffb59ae5f9b5ed67a9-Abstract.html), [code](https://github.com/rgeirhos/generalisation-humans-DNNs), [summary](https://jasonleex1995.github.io/docs/07_papers/1808.08750.html)  
Compare the robustness of humans and DNNs (VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet) on object recognition under 12 different image distortions.  
Human visual system is more robust than DNNs.  
DNNs generalize so poorly under non-i.i.d. settings.
