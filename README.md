**AnomalyCLIP: Object-agnostic Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection**  
*ICLR 2024*, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18961), [review](https://openreview.net/forum?id=buC4E91xZE), [code](https://github.com/zqhang/AnomalyCLIP), [summary](https://jasonleex1995.github.io/docs/07_papers/2310.18961.html)  
Task: zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD)  
Previous works used CLIP with object-aware text prompts.  
Even though the foreground object semantics can be completely different, anomaly patterns remain quite similar.  
Thus, learning object-agnostic text prompts is the key for ZSAD.  



**Generalisation in humans and deep neural networks**    
*NeurIPS 2018*, 
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08750), [review](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/hash/0937fb5864ed06ffb59ae5f9b5ed67a9-Abstract.html), [code](https://github.com/rgeirhos/generalisation-humans-DNNs), [summary](https://jasonleex1995.github.io/docs/07_papers/1808.08750.html)  
Compare the robustness of humans and DNNs (VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet) on object recognition under 12 different image distortions.  
Human visual system is more robust than DNNs.  
DNNs generalize so poorly under non-i.i.d. settings.
